## Information

"This project includes some differences from what is shown in the content. Instead of the Goerli Testnet, Sepolia ETH was used. This means you need to create a wallet address connected to the Sepolia network. On the client side, you should create your own `.env` file named `VITE_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID=yourkey` and generate your Thirdweb API key, including the client ID found there. On the server side, you should again create a `.env` file and specify the `PRIVATE_KEY=yourkey` variable, entering the account details from your crypto wallet and including the private key in that section."
